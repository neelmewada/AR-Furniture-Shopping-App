# AR based Furniture Shopping iOS App

An AR based Furniture Shopping iOS App made with UIKit and Swift. I developed this project to showcase and demonstrate exactly how AR techonology can be used by Furniture eCommerce companies to let customers try out their furnitures right in their home and increase their likeliness to purchase it.

**Technologies Used**: Swift, MVVM design pattern, UIKit, ARKit, SceneKit, Firebase

### Overview & Features

- Made with UIKit framework in Swift.
- Completely programmatic UI. No storyboards or interface builders used.
- Used ARKit for visualization of furniture 3D models.
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture used.
- Integrated Firebase for App backend, allowing products to be stored persistently in Cloud Firestore and retrieve them in real-time.
- Caching for images.
- Built Custom UI elements from scratch.
- Used Figma for UI/UX design
- More features and updates are coming soon. (Work in progress)
